Tricky Python Theory Questions
1. What is the difference between shallow copy and deep copy in Python?   Explain with examples when and why you would use one over the other.

shallow copy : - if we change in copy of original think its also reflect in the original think then its copy tell as a shallow copy
deep copy : - if we change in copy of original think its not reflect in the original think then its copy tell as a deep copy
    
    example : -
        list1 = [1,2,3,4,[5,6]]
        list2 = list1.copy()
        list2[0] = 99
        list2[4][0] = 100

        print(list1)
        print(list2)

        output : - 
            [1,2,3,4,[100,6]]   => list1 
            [99,2,3,4,[100,6]]  => list2 

    here during to the copy of the list1 the elements of the list1 in deep copy but  during to the copy nested list of the list1 only address of that nested list ([5,6]) was copy 
    - so,that if we make change in that nested list which shallow copy in the list2 is also reflected in the list1 nested list 
    - And if we change in the elements which the deeply copyed in the list3 is doesn't refelcted in the list1 





4. What are Python’s mutable and immutable data types? Explain the differences, with examples, and discuss how mutability impacts performance and memory management.
    
    immutable onejects : string,tuple,frozenset
    mutable : list,dictionary 

    - immutable : - we doesn't modification in that object 
    - mutable : - we modification in that object

    example :
        string = "apple"
        string[0] = "p"
        print(string)

        list1 = [1,2,3,4]
        list1[0] = 21
        print(list1)

        output : 
            apple
            [21,2,3,4]

        here string is immutable so we can't modification in the string charcters 
        and list is mutable so we can modification the list elements
    


5. Explain how Python’s `__init__` and `__new__` methods work in object-oriented programming.   What is the difference between them, and when would you use one over the other?

    __init__ 
        - is the one of the magic method which directly execute the when the object of the class have been created
    
    __new__ 
        - is the method which help us to create in the classes , we can use that method in the meta class
        - if the Python calls the Meta.__new__ method to create the class.



6. What is the purpose of decorators in Python?   Discuss how decorators work, including how they can be used for logging, authentication, and more.

    purpose : the purpose of the decorators is to modify or add more functionality to the fucntion without changing the actual fucntion code.

    how decorators work : decorators is use to pass the  some fucntion in to that fucntion which use as a decorator
    
    how they can be used for logging, authentication, and more

     we consider the case of the authentication
        - in the authenticattion so many methods are there to authenticate the use like via google acc, facebook, email and password so we need to impliment all method in one fucntion
            but using to the decorator we can be apple main authentication fucntion as decorator and use that all method in main fucntion so here we are use the main fucntion without the change the actial fucntion code
            
    




7. Explain the difference between `is` and `==` in Python.   When should you use `is` and when should you use `==`? Provide examples to support your explanation.

The main difference between is and == in Python is their purpose and how they compare objects:
    
    is operator:
        Checks for object identity (if two variables point to the exact same object in memory)
        Compares the memory addresses of objects
        Generally faster than ==

    
    == operator:
        Checks for value equality (if two objects have the same value)
        Compares the contents or values of objects
        Can be overridden by classes to define custom equality behavior

9. What are Python’s built-in `staticmethod` and `classmethod`?   Discuss their differences, and provide an example of when each would be used.


11. What is a Python generator, and how does it differ from a function?    Explain the `yield` keyword, how generators work, and the benefits of using them for large datasets.



12. What is the difference between a list comprehension and a generator expression?    Discuss the syntax and memory efficiency differences between the two.
13. Explain Python’s `with` statement and how context managers work.    What are context managers, and how does the `with` statement simplify resource management like file handling?
14. What is the difference between `@staticmethod`, `@classmethod`, and `@property` in Python?    Explain the role of each decorator with examples, and when to use them.

15. Explain how Python’s exception handling mechanism works.    Discuss the purpose of `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks, and when to use each.

    definition :- exceptions are errors that occur during the execution of a program
    how to its work :- so  exception handling mechanism first tring to execute the code but during to the the execution if any problem or somthing that make error then exception handling mechanism generate the error 
    syntax :- try:
                # code that may raise an exception
            except ExceptionType:
                # code that handles the exception
            else:
                # code that runs if no exception occurs
            finally:
                # code that runs regardless of whether an exception occurs or not

16. What are Python's lambda functions? How do they differ from regular functions?    Explain the syntax and use cases for `lambda` functions in Python.
    
    python Lambda/Anonymous Function
        lambda / Anonymous Function is the type of the fucntion which doesn't need to name of the fucntion it's directly use by using lamba keywork
    
    How do they differ from regular functions :
        
        normal fucntion :
            - need to define with the name 
            - need to call by its name for use or execution of that function

        Lambda/Anonymous Function : 
            - not need to define 
            - not to call, it's directly execute when that come to Interpret

        syntax : 
            lambda arguments: expression

        example :-
            lambda x: x + 1
            print(lambda x: x + 1(1)) => 2  


17. What is the difference between a tuple and a list in Python?    Discuss the key differences, including performance, mutability, and use cases.


18. What is the role of `self` in Python classes?    Explain its significance in instance methods and how it is used to refer to instance variables.
19. How do Python's `set` and `frozenset` differ?    Discuss the characteristics and use cases for each, including immutability in `frozenset`.









2. How does Python’s memory management work?   Discuss the concept of reference counting, garbage collection, and the role of the `gc` module.
3. What is the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python?   Explain how it affects multithreading in Python and why Python cannot fully utilize multi-core processors for parallel execution.
8. How does Python handle variable scope and name resolution? Explain the LEGB (Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in) rule with examples.
10. What are the differences between Python 2 and Python 3?    Highlight the key changes between the two versions and how they affect coding style and functionality.
